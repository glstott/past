Phylogenetic Analysis Sampling Tool (PAST) is a tool which allows you to randomly select a balanced and well-spread subsample from a population of sequences prior to subsequent phylogenetic analysis. PAST makes use of the LCUBE algorithm developed by Grafstrom and Tille, 2013. 

## Why though?

With the explosion in available sequence data for phylogenetic analysis, we have moved from a problem of insufficient data to resolve evolutionary relationships to a problem of too much data to readily make use of more computationally intensive Bayesian methods. Furthermore, the data which we collect tend to be heavily influenced by whether it is sampled from a high-resource region or is from a host of concern/priority. As we down-sample our datasets, it's important to keep in mind the disparities between these hosts, locations, etc. Currently, there are sampling tools which select for a subset of distance measures, but there is not yet a tool which is able to create a balanced and well-spread sample across an arbitrary number of relevant variables.
